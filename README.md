To set up this bot for your own use, do the following:

Download this: [this](https://github.com/L1Pritchard/Ulala_Bot/archive/master.zip)

Add a file called **config.json** which contains:

*{
    "prefix": "!",
    "token": "YOUR-DISCORD-BOT-TOKEN",
    "botowner": "YOUR-DISCORD-ID"
}*

obviously changing the words for numbers

it *should* be able to run like that
